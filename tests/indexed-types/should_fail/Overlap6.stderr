    Couldn't match type ‛x’ with ‛And x 'True’
      ‛x’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for
            g :: Proxy Bool x -> Proxy Bool (And x 'True)
          at Overlap6.hs:14:6
    Expected type: Proxy Bool (And x 'True)
      Actual type: Proxy Bool x
    Relevant bindings include
      g :: Proxy Bool x -> Proxy Bool (And x 'True)
        (bound at Overlap6.hs:15:1)
      x :: Proxy Bool x (bound at Overlap6.hs:15:3)
    In the expression: x
    In an equation for ‛g’: g x = x
