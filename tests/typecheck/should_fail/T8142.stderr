    Couldn't match type ‛Nu f0’ with ‛Nu f’
    NB: ‛Nu’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable ‛f0’ is ambiguous
    Expected type: a -> Nu f
      Actual type: a -> Nu f0
    When checking that ‛h’
      has the inferred type ‛forall (f :: * -> *) a. a -> Nu f’
    Probable cause: the inferred type is ambiguous
    In an equation for ‛tracer’:
        tracer
          = h
          where
              h = (\ (_, b) -> ((outI . fmap h) b)) . out

    Occurs check: cannot construct the infinite type: a ~ f1 a
    Expected type: a -> (t0, f1 a)
      Actual type: Nu ((,) t0) -> (t0, Nu ((,) t0))
    Relevant bindings include h :: a -> Nu f1 (bound at T8142.hs:6:18)
    In the second argument of ‛(.)’, namely ‛out’
    In the expression: (\ (_, b) -> ((outI . fmap h) b)) . out
